# The Witness Example

This SVG Tiler mapping file was originally created for the paper
"[Who witnesses The Witness?  Finding witnesses in The Witness is hard
and sometimes impossible]"(https://erikdemaine.org/papers/Witness_TCS/)
by Zachary Abel, Jeffrey Bosboom, Michael Coulombe, Erik D. Demaine,
Linus Hamilton, Adam Hesterberg, Justin Kopinsky, Jayson Lynch, Mikhail Rudoy,
and Clemens Thielen.
In fact, this SVG Tiler was originally created to enable these figures,
and the two evolved extensively together in the early days.
